        "roles": [
          "As part of Architecture Team I was designing technical solutions for Apsis Pro and Integrations using Domain-Driven Design. Some of them were enhancements to an existing legacy ASP.Net MVC code and some were greenfield designs that were then implemented as AngularJS front-end and ASP.Net WebAPI back-end. I was also involved in technical designs for public REST API improvements, high volume importer performance optimization and push integration rewrite. I took part in choosing the technology that was later used for implementation. My responsibilities were to ensure compatibility with the existing system while allowing high performance, good security, maintainability and deployment story.",
          "As a Tech Lead, I provided mentoring about in-house solutions, architecture and infrastructure. I was approving various implementation choices like database design, libraries, infrastructure alignment etc. I helped developers writing clean and maintainable code that keeps all the SOLID Principles, is properly Unit-Tested and designed according to Apsis DDD Guidance and Coding Standard. I was involved in teaching developers how to conduct a productive Code Review.",
          "As emerging DevOps culture in Apsis was one of my main focuses, I co-authored the Release Process to ensure quick and safe updates to production. I then became the Release Manager. I was co-ordinating release testing and live deployment. We used Git, TFS and Release Management for CI. I also helped maintaining and growing production, staging and development infrastructure implemented as VMs on various cloud computing providers.",
          "Never lost that passion for code, so I still contributed the development and maintenance of multiple web apps, APIs and integration solutions.",
          "I co-designed and took part in On-Call Process that is a 24/7 developer and admin support that improves stability and availability of Apsis Pro and Integrations.",
          "I was given a pleasure of leading a team of 5 great developers in Warsaw. I helped them plan their projects and made sure the have no obstacles. We used our interpretation of Scrum for bigger, more plannable implementations and Kanban for maintenance. I kept track of my teammates work and was responsible for performance reviews and bonuses. I was also interviewing new hires.",
          "Finally, I represented the company in Poland and managed the office in Warsaw."

          "The code I was exposed to consisted mostly of legacy ASP.Net and ASP.Net MVC web apps with a considerable amount of front-end code in JavaScript using jQuery. Later I had an opportunity to change the background processing apps among which builders taking care of rendering and sending the emails and NServiceBus-based message processors are most noteworthy. Finally I got to write code in public REST API and mailing list importers. I was also involved in changing legacy T-SQL stored procedures.",
          "When a proper Continuous Integration turned out to be needed, together with a consultant hired for this purpose I was coding an in-house, custom deployment solution in Ruby and PowerShell."
